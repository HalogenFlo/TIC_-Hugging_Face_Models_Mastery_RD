#### Technical Comparison: ML vs DL Pipeline

| Pipeline Step | Machine Learning (ML) | Deep Learning (DL) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Feature Extraction** | **Manual:** Requires domain expertise to select features. | **Automatic:** Layers learn features directly from raw data. |
| **Data Requirements** | Works well with smaller, structured datasets. | Requires large-scale unstructured data (Images, Text). |
| **Hardware** | Optimized for **CPU** execution. | Heavily dependent on **GPU/TPU** (Parallel Processing). |
| **Preprocessing** | Scaling, Normalization, One-hot encoding. | Tokenization (NLP) or Patching (Vision Transformers). |
| **Training Time** | Minutes to hours. | Hours to days (requires Transfer Learning for efficiency). |
| **Interpretability** | High (e.g., Decision Trees, Coefficients). | Low ("Black Box" nature of deep neural networks). |
